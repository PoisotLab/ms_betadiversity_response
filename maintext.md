title: "Dissimilarity of species interaction networks: how to quantify the impact of species turnover?"
---

Ecological networks are variable both in time and space [@Poisot2015SpeWhy;
@Trojelsgaard2016EcoNet] - this variability motivated the emergence of
methodology to compare ecological networks, in a way that meshes with the usual
approaches of comparison of ecological communities, *i.e.* $\beta$-diversity;
although the definiton of $\beta$-diversity is a contentious topic amongst
community ecologists [see *e.g.* @Tuomisto2010DivBet], the need to understand
network variability is motivated by the fact that species that make up the
networks do not react to their environment in the same way, and therefore the
$\beta$-diversity of networks may behave in complex ways.

@Poisot2012DisSpe and @Canard2014EmpEva have suggested an approach to
$\beta$-diversity for ecological networks which is based on the comparison of
shared and unique links among species, and differentiate this sharing of links
between common and unique species. This framework can be summarized as
$\beta_{wn} = \beta_{os} + \beta_{st}$, namely the fact that overall network
dissimilarity ($\beta_{wn}$) has a component that can be calculated directly
from the dissimilarity of interactions between shared species ($\beta_{os}$),
and a component that cannot, the later originating in unique species introducing
their unique interactions ($\beta_{st}$). This approach has been widely adopted
since its publication, with recent examples using it to understand the effect of
fire on pollination systems [@Baronio2021NatFir]; the impact of rewiring on
spatio-temporal network dynamics [@Campos-Moreno2021ImpInt]; the effects of
farming on rural and urban landscapes on species interactions
[@Olsson2021IntPla]; and as a tool to estimate the sampling completeness of
networks [@Souza2021PlaSam]. It has, similarly, received a number of extensions,
including the ability to account for interaction strength [@Magrach2017PlaNet],
the ability to handle probabilistic ecological networks [@Poisot2016StrPro], and
the integration into the Local Contribution to Beta Diversity
[@Legendre2013BetDiv] approach to understand how environment changes drive
network dissimilarity [@Poisot2017HosPar].

In a  recent contribution, @Frund2021DisSpe argues that the calculation of
network dissimilarity terms as outlined by @Poisot2012DisSpe is incorrect, as it
can lead to over-estimating the role of interactions between shared species in a
network ("rewiring"), and therefore underestimate the importance of species
turnover across networks. Here, I present a more thorough justification of the
methodological choices for the @Poisot2012DisSpe method, explain how information
about species turnover can be extracted from its decomposition, and conduct
numerical experiments to guide the interpretation of the $\beta$-diversity
values thus obtained.

## Partitioning network dissimilarity

The approach to quantifying the difference between pairs of networks established
in @Poisot2012DisSpe is a simple extension of the overall method by
@Koleff2003MeaBet for species dissimilarity baed on presence-absence data. The
objects to compare, $X_1$ and $X_2$, are partitioned into three values, $a =
|X_1 \cup X_2|$, $b = |X_2 \setminus X_1|$, and $c = |X_1 \setminus X_2|$, where
$|x|$ is the cardinality of set $x$, and $\setminus$ is the set substraction
operation. In the perspective of species composition comparison, $X_1$ and $X_2$
are the sets of species in either community, so that if $X_1 = \{x, y, z\}$ and
$X_2 = \{v, w, x, y\}$, we have $X_1 \cup X_2 = \{v, w, x, y, z\}$, $X_1 \cap
X_2 = \{x, y\}$, $X_2 \setminus X_1 = \{v, w\}$, and $X_1 \setminus X_2 =
\{z\}$. The core message of @Koleff2003MeaBet is that the overwheling majority
of measures of $\beta$-diversity can be re-expressed as functions that operate
on the cardinality (number of elements) of these sets.

### Re-expressing networks as sets

Applying this framework to networks requires a few additional definitions.
Although ecologists tend to think of networks as their adjacency matrix, this
representation is far from optimal to get a solid understanding of which
elements should be counted as part of which set when measuring network
dissimilarity. For this reason, we need fall back on the definition of a graph
as a pair of sets, wherein $\mathcal{G} = (V, E)$. These two components $V$ and
$E$ represent vertices (nodes, species) and edges (interactions), where $V$ is
specifically a set containing the vertices $\mathcal{G}$, and $E$ is a set of
ordered pairs, in which every pair is composed of two elements of $V$; an
element $\{i,j\}$ in $E$ indicates that there is an interaction *from* species
$i$ to species $j$ in the network $\mathcal{G}$.

In the context of networks comparison (assuming the networks to compare are
$\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$), we can further decompose the contents of these
sets as 

$$\mathcal{M} = (V_c \cup V_m, E_c \cup E_{sm} \cup E_{um}) \,,$$

and 

$$\mathcal{M} = (V_c \cup V_n, E_c \cup E_{sn} \cup E_{un}) \,,$$

where $V_c$ is the set of shared species, $V_k$ are the species belonging only
to network $k$, $E_c$ are the shared edges, and $E_{sk}$ and $E_{uk}$ are the
interactions unique to $k$ involving, respectively, only species in $V_c$, and
at least one species from $V_k$.

### Defining the partitions from networks as sets

The metaweb [@Dunne2006NetStr], which is to say the entire regional species pool
and their interaction, can be defined as $\mathcal{M} \cup \mathcal{N}$ (this
operation is commutative), which is to say

$$\mathcal{M} \cup \mathcal{N} = (V_c \cup V_m \cup V_n, E_c \cup E_{sm} \cup E_{um} \cup E_{sn} \cup E_{un}) \,.$$

This operation gives us an equivalent to $\gamma$-diversity for networks, in
that the set of vertices contains *all* species from the two networks, and the
set of edges contains *all* the interactions between these species. If, further,
we make the usual assumption that only species with at least one interaction are
present in the set of vertices, then all elements of the set of vertices are
present at least once in the set of edges, and the set of vertices can be entire
reconstructed from the set of edges. Although measures of network
$\beta$-diversity operate on interactions (not species), this property is
maintained at every decomposition we will describe next.

We can similarly define the intersection (similarly commutative) of two
networks:
 
$$\mathcal{M} \cap \mathcal{N} = (V_c, E_c)\,.$$

The decomposition of $\beta$-diversity from @Poisot2012DisSpe uses these
components to measure $\beta_{os}$ (the interaction dissimilarity between shared
species, which @Frund2021DisSpe terms "rewiring"), and $\beta_{wn}$ (the overall
dissimilarity including non-shared species). We can express the components $a$,
$b$, and $c$ of @Koleff2003MeaBet as the cardinality of the following sets:

| Component    | $a$   | $b$                  | $c$                  |
| ------------ | ----- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| $\beta_{os}$ | $E_c$ | $E_{sn}$             | $E_{sm}$             |
| $\beta_{wn}$ | $E_c$ | $E_{sn} \cup E_{un}$ | $E_{sm} \cup E_{um}$ |

## Quantifying the importance of species turnover

The difference between $\beta_{os}$ and $\beta_{wn}$ stems from the species
dissimilarity between $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$, and it is easier to
understand the effect of turnover by picking a dissimilarity measure to work as
an exemplar. At this point, @Frund2021DisSpe introduce a confusin terminology in
their work, stating that S\o rensen's and Whittaker's measures of dissimilarity
are the same in the @Koleff2003MeaBet framework (they are not; in practice,
$\beta_{Sor}=1-\beta_{w}$), and (ii) noting Whittaker's measure as
$(b+c)/(2a+b+c)$, which in the @Koleff2003MeaBet framework is, in fact,
$\beta_t$ [@Wilson1984MeaBet]. This does not change the overall conclusions as
these measures can be re-expressed to converge to the same value. For the sake
of consistency, I will use $\beta_t$ moving forward; it returns values in
$[0,1]$, with $0$ meaning complete similarity, and $1$ meaning complete
dissimilarity.

### Establishing that $\beta_{wn} \ge \beta_{os}$ 

Based on a partition between three sets of cardinality $a$, $b$, and $c$, 

$$\beta_t = \frac{b+c}{2a+b+c}\,.$$

So as to simplify the notation of the following section, I will introduce a
series of new variables. Let $A = |E_c|$ be the number of links that are
identical between networks; $S = |E_{sn} \cup E_{sm}|$ be the number of links
that are not shared, but only involve shared species (*i.e.* links from
$\mathcal{M}\cup\mathcal{N}$ established between species from
$\mathcal{M}\cap\mathcal{N}$); and $U = |E_{un} \cup E_{um}|$ the number of
links that are not shared, and involve at least one unique species. Adopting the
perspective developed in the previous section, wherein networks are sets and the
measures of $\beta$-diversity operates on these sets, highlights the conceptual
issue in the @Frund2021DisSpe alternative normalization: they are using
components of the networks that are *not* part of the networks being compared.

There are two important points to note here. First, the number or proportion of
species that are shared is not involved in the calculation. Second, the
connectance of either network is not involved in the calculation. That all links
counted in *e.g.* $U$ come from $\mathcal{M}$, or that they are evenly
distributed between $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$, has no impact on the
result. This is a desirable property of the approach: whatever quantitative
value of the components of dissimilarity can be interpreted in the light of the
connectance and species turnover *without* any risk of circularity. Therefore
the argument of @Frund2021DisSpe, whereby the $\beta_{os}$ component should
decrease with turnover, and be invariant to connectance, does not hold: the very
point of the approach is to provide measures that can be interpreted in the
light of connectance and species turnover.

The final component of network dissimilarity in @Poisot2012DisSpe is
$\beta_{st}$, *i.e.* the part of $\beta_{wn}$ that is not explained by changes
in interactions between shared species ($\beta_{os}$), and therefore stems from
species turnover. This fraction is defined as $\beta_{st} =
\beta_{wn}-\beta_{os}$.

The expression of $\beta_{st}$ does not involve a partition into sets that can
be plugged into the framework of @Koleff2003MeaBet, because the part of
$\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ that are composed of their unique species
cannot, by definition, share interactions. One could, theoretically, express
these as $\mathcal{M} \setminus \mathcal{N} = (V_m, E_{um})$ and $\mathcal{N}
\setminus \mathcal{M} = (V_v, E_{un})$ (note the non-commutativity here), but
the dissimilarity between these networks is trivially maximal for the measures
considered.

Using the $\beta_t$ measure of dissimilarity, we can re-write (using the
notation with $A$, $S$, and $U$)

$$\beta_{os} = \frac{S}{2A+S}\,,$$

and

$$\beta_{wn} = \frac{S+U}{2A+S+U}\,.$$

Note that $\beta_{os}$ has the form $x/y$ with $x = S$ and $y = 2A+S$, and
$\beta_{wn}$ has the form $(x+k)/(y+k)$, with $k = U$. As long as $k \ge 0$, it
is guaranteed that $\beta_{wn} \ge \beta_{os}$, and therefore that $0 \ge
\beta_{st} \ge 1$; as $A$, $S$, and $U$ are cardinalities of sets, they are
necessarily satisfying this condition.

We can get an expression for $\beta_{st}$, by bringing $\beta_{os}$ and
$\beta_{wn}$ to a common denominator and simplifying the numerator:

$$\beta_{st} = \frac{2AU}{(2A+S)(2A+S+U)}\,.$$

Note that this value varies in a non-monotonic way with regards to the number of
interactions that are part of the common set of species -- this is obvious when
developing the denominator into

$$4A^2 + S^2 + 4AS + 2AU + SU\,,$$

As such, we expect that the value of $\beta_{st}$ will vary in a hump-shaped way
with the proportion of shared interactions. For this reason, @Poisot2012DisSpe
suggest that $\beta_{st}/\beta{wn}$ (alt. $1-\beta_{os}/\beta_{wn}$) is a better
indicator of the *relative* importance of turnover processes on network
dissimilarity. This can be calculated as 

$$\frac{\beta_{st}}{\beta_{wn}} = \frac{2AU}{(2A+S)(2A+S+U)}\times\frac{S+U}{2A+S+U}\,,$$

which reduces to 

$$\frac{\beta_{st}}{\beta_{wn}} = \frac{2AU}{(2A+S)(S+U)}\,.$$

The roots of this expression are $A=0$ (the turnover of species has no
contribution to the difference between $\beta_{wn}$ and $\beta_{os}$ if there
are no shared species, and therefore no rewiring), and  for $U = 0$ (the
turnover of species has no contribution if all species are shared).

### Numerical experiment: response of the components to different sources of network variation

To illustrate the behavior of $\beta_{st}$, I conducted a simple numerical
experiment in which two networks have the same number of interactions $L$
(recall from the previous section that we do not need to set a number of species
yet), and these interactions are partitionned according to proportions $p_s$ and
$p_r$ into shared ($A$), rewired ($S$), and unique ($U$) links, with $A =
p_s\times L$, $S = (1-p_s)\times p_r\times L$, and $U = (1-p_s)\times
(1-p_r)\times L$. The results are represented in @fig:numexp1.

![Values of $\beta_{os}$, $\beta_{wn}$, $\beta_{st}$, and
$\beta_{st}/\beta_{wn}$ as a function of the proportion of rewired links and the
proportion of shared links.](numexp1.png){#fig:numexp1}

## Is this decomposition over-estimating the effect of "rewiring"?

One of the arguments put forth by @Frund2021DisSpe is that the decomposition
outlined above will overestimate the effect of rewiring; I argue that this is
based on a misunderstanding of what $\beta_{st}$ achieves. It is paramount to
clarify that $\beta_{st}$ is not a direct measure of the importance of turnover:
it is a quantification of the relative impact of rewiring to overall
dissimilarity, which, all non-turnover mechanisms being accounted for in the
decomposition, can be explained by turnover mechanisms.

### Illustrations on arbitrarily small networks are biased

We can re-calculate the illustration of @Frund2021DisSpe, wherein a pair of
networks with two shared interactions ($A = 2$) receive either an interaction in
$S$, in $U$, or in both:

| $A$ | $S$ | $U$ | $\beta_{os}$ | $\beta_{wn}$ | $\beta_{st}$ | $\beta_{st}/\beta_{wn}$ |
| --- | --- | --- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| 2   | 0   | 0   | 0            | 0            | 0            |                         |
| 2   | 1   | 0   | $1/5$        | $1/5$        | 0            | 0                       |
| 2   | 0   | 1   | 0            | $1/5$        | $1/5$        | 0                       |
| 2   | 1   | 1   | $1/5$        | $1/3$        | $2/15$       | $2/5$                   |

The over-estimation argument hinges on the fact that $\beta_{st} < \beta_{os}$
in the last situation (one interaction as rewiring, one as turnover). Reaching
the conclusion of an overestimation from this is based on a mis-interpretation
of what $\beta_{st}$ means. The correct interpretation is that, out of the
entire network dissimilarity, only three-fifths are explained by re-wiring. The
fact that this fraction is not exactly one-half comes from the fact that the
@Wilson1984MeaBet measure counts shared interactions *twice* (*i.e.* it has a
$2A$ term), which over-amplifies the effect of shared interactions as the
network is really small. Running the same calculations with $A = 10$ gives a
relative importance of the turnover processes of 47%, and $\beta_{st}$ goes to
$1/2$ as $A/(S+U)$ increases. As an additional caveat, the value of $\beta_{st}$
will depend on the measure of beta-diversity used. Measures that do not count
the shared interaction twice are not going to amplify the effect of rewiring.

## Does the partition of network dissimilarity needs a new normalization?

Based on the arguments presented above, I do not think the suggestion of
@Frund2021DisSpe to change the denominator of $\beta_{os}$ makes sense as a
default; the strength of the original approach by @Poisot2012DisSpe is indeed
that the effect of turnover is based on a rigorous definition of networks as
graphs (as opposed to networks as matrices), in which the induction of vertices
from the edgelist being compared gives rise to biologically meaningful
denominators. The advantage of this approach is that at no time does the
turnover of species itself, or the connectance of the network, enter into the
calculation. As such, it is possible to use $\beta_{os}$ and $\beta_{wn}$ in
relationship to these terms, calculated externally [as was recently done by
*e.g.* @Higino2021BetPhy] without creating circularities.

The choice of changing the denominator hinges on what one admits as a definition
for $\beta_{st}$. If the point of $\beta_{st}$ is to be a component of overall
$\beta$-diversity as advocated by @Frund2021DisSpe and @Novotny2009BetDiv, a
change of numerator *might* be acceptable. Nevertheless, this change of
numerator contributes to blurring the frontier between a measure of interaction
dissimilarity and a measure of community dissimilarity, and may warrant a full
methodological assessment. Conversely, if as we argue in @Poisot2012DisSpe,
$\beta_{st}$ is to be meant as a *guide* to the interpretation of $\beta_{wn}$
and $\beta_{os}$, and related to actual measures of species turnover and network
connectance, one must not change the denominator. It is central to recognize
that there are multiple reasons to calculate network dissimilarity, and it is
our opinion that the arguments levied by @Frund2021DisSpe against the original
partition stem from a misunderstanding of what it intends to do (and does,
indeed, do well), not from intrinsic methodological issues in the partition
itself.
