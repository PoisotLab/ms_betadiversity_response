\caption{The dissimilarity of two networks (green and orange) of equal
richness \(S\) (this also holds for unequal richness) depends on three
families of interactions: those that are unique because of species
turnover (in a pale color), those that are unique because of rewiring
(in a saturated color), and those that are shared (in black). Assuming
that the chance of sharing a species between the two networks is \(p\),
then there can be at most \(p^2\times S^2\) shared links -- for this
reason, overall network dissimilarity (\(\beta_{wn}\)) will have a
component tied to species turnover, which is
\(\beta_{st}\).}\label{fig:conceptual}

sharing a link (\(x\)-axis), and the probability \(p\) of sharing a
species (\(y\)-axis). Larger values indicate \emph{more} dissimilarity,
such that for \(p=q=1\) the dissimilarity as measured by
\(\beta_{wn}=0\), and for \(p=q=0\) the dissimilarity as measured by
\(\beta_{wn}=1\). As expected, the relative importance of turnover
(\(\beta_{st}\)) is maximal when there is no rewiring, and when turnover
increases.}\label{fig:turnrew}

equally species-rich networks on the decomposition of network
beta-diversity, assuming \(p = 0.8\). Networks with stronger differences
in connectance will tend to be more similar, because the differences in
number of links becomes extreme enough that the chances of all the links
in the sparser network being in the denser network
increases.}\label{fig:connectance}
